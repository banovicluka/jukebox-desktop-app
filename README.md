# Jukebox application

A simple Jukebox application implemented in C# and WPF technology with all the functionalities of a regular Jukebox machine. The complete application consists of a single screen where basic Jukebox components can be observed, such as a list of songs to choose from, a queue of songs to be played in the selected order. Various manipulations are possible with the currently playing song, such as volume reduction, muting, or pausing, as well as adding it to favorite songs.
